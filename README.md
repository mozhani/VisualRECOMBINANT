# VisualRECOMBINANT
A cognitive process to combine two concepts creatively.

VisualRECOMBINANT is a computational cognitive process that combines two concepts creatively resulting in a visual combination of the concepts. 
Concepts are considered as the basic mental representations, and their inconsistencies (compared to empirical human data) raised through their combination by classic models lay the foundation to  propose a method for combining concepts and finding creative ideas while resolving these inconsistencies. Finally, the set of extracted ideas is visualized into a collage as the VisualRECOMBINANT artifact.

- Triger the VisualRECOMBINANT by a stimulus consisting two concepts separated by comma, e.g. 'war, kid'
- The VisualRECOMBINANT reviews her memories to recall the most related episodes in her episodic memory based on Bell inequality to measur quantum entanglement. Why? It's a measure to assess the potentiality of the emergence of new meanings based on the stimulus.
