# VisualRECOMBINANT
A cognitive process to combine two concepts creatively.

VisualRECOMBINANT is a computational cognitive process that combines two concepts creatively resulting in a visual combination of the concepts. 
Concepts are considered as the basic mental representations, and their inconsistencies (compared to empirical human data) raised through their combination by classic models lay the foundation to  propose a method for combining concepts and finding creative ideas while resolving these inconsistencies. Finally, the set of extracted ideas is visualized into a collage as the VisualRECOMBINANT artifact.

- Triger the VisualRECOMBINANT by a stimulus consisting two concepts separated by comma, e.g. 'war, kid'
- The VisualRECOMBINANT reviews her memories to recall the most related episodes in her episodic memory based on Bell inequality to measur quantum entanglement. Why? It's a measure to assess the potentiality of the emergence of new meanings based on the stimulus.

>### An excerpt from the paper's Evaluation and Comparisons section:
>- **Interpreting Query 1: (War and kid)** The output results for the first query, `war` and `kid`,are shown in Table 4. Through descriptive-verbal assessment, the extracted concepts and expressions are analyzed. Some selected keywords have a direct clear-cut relationship with either concept in the query, such as `war plane` and `soldier` connected to the concept `war`, also, `kid` and `child` connected to the concept `kid`. Some other expressions and concepts have a remoteassociation with the query. For instance, the word `dad` appears in the list of selected keywords, while the word `mother` does not appear solely. However, the expression `whose mom` has been selected. To provide an interpretation of these selections, it would be comprehensible that, firstly, the semantic meaning of punishment is further in the relationship of father and child instead of mother and child [51]. Also, `whose mom`, a part of `Whose mom is she`? is reminiscent of siblings' rivalries and their ghts over their mother by saying, `"She is the mother of only one of them"`. Also, athers go to war more than mothers. Thus, it is clear that the war's adverse eect on kids could be understandable for losing their fathers. Children damaged by paint in the context of `war` and `kid` are reminiscent of games like paintball or color war. Statistical reports show that suicide among `children` and `young people` is nearly 10% on a global scale (26 countries involved in this study), and the ratio is rising gradually. Also, serious `suicidal thoughts` among children and young people reached 17% [63]. The `tween` age is when the children usually experience their most rebellious period as well as an internal war with the environment. On the other hand, younger players are more likely to ght with their teammates and rivals at a younger age. In the meantime, with further investigations of the `deal nation`, the authors realized that `"I Deal"` is a group that designs creative skills and activities for war-torn children to bring them back to everyday pre-war life. The only example in which the authors have not found any connection between `kid` and `war` is the expression `old animal`.
