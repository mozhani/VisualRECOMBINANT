# VisualRECOMBINANT
A cognitive process to combine two concepts creatively.

VisualRECOMBINANT is a computational cognitive process that combines two concepts creatively resulting in a visual combination of the concepts. 
Concepts are considered as the basic mental representations, and their inconsistencies (compared to empirical human data) raised through their combination by classic models lay the foundation to  propose a method for combining concepts and finding creative ideas while resolving these inconsistencies. Finally, the set of extracted ideas is visualized into a collage as the VisualRECOMBINANT artifact.

- Triger the VisualRECOMBINANT by a stimulus consisting two concepts separated by comma, e.g. 'war, kid'
- The VisualRECOMBINANT reviews her memories to recall the most related episodes in her episodic memory based on Bell inequality to measur quantum entanglement. Why? It's a measure to assess the potentiality of the emergence of new meanings based on the stimulus.

- Interpreting Query 1: War and kid
The output results for the rst query, `war' and `kid',
are shown in Table 4. Through descriptive-verbal
assessment, the extracted concepts and expressions are
analyzed. Some selected keywords have a direct clear-
cut relationship with either concept in the query, such
as `war plane' and `soldier' connected to the concept
`war', `kid', and `child' connected to the concept `kid'.
Some other expressions and concepts have a remote
association with the query. For instance, the word
`dad' appears in the list of selected keywords, while
the word `mother' does not appear solely. However,
the expression `whose mom' has been selected. To
provide an interpretation of these selections, it would
be comprehensible that, rstly, the semantic meaning
of punishment is further in the relationship of father
and child instead of mother and child [51]. Also,
`whose mom', a part of `Whose mom is she'? is
reminiscent of siblings' rivalries and their ghts over
their mother by saying, \She is the mother of only
one of them". Also, fathers go to war more than
mothers. Thus, it is clear that the war's adverse
eect on kids could be understandable for losing their
fathers. Children damaged by paint in the context of
`war' and `kid' are reminiscent of games like paintball
or color war. Statistical reports show that suicide
among `children' and `young people' is nearly 10% on
a global scale (26 countries involved in this study), and
the ratio is rising gradually. Also, serious `suicidal
thoughts' among children and young people reached
17% [63]. The `tween' age is when the children usually
experience their most rebellious period as well as an
internal war with the environment. On the other
hand, younger players are more likely to ght with
their teammates and rivals at a younger age. In
the meantime, with further investigations of the `deal
nation', the authors realized that \I Deal" is a group
that designs creative skills and activities for war-torn
children to bring them back to everyday pre-war life.
The only example in which the authors have not found
any connection between `kid' and `war' is the expression
`old animal'.
